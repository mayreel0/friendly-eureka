# Agent Instructions

## Project Wiki Mode

When the user says "위키 모드", "Project Wiki Mode", or asks to work on this project with wiki documentation, follow these rules.

### Work Root

Do actual implementation, debugging, testing, and command execution in this repository, meaning the directory that contains this `AGENTS.md` file.

Do not create project wiki documents inside this repository unless the user explicitly asks.

### Required Environment

Before writing wiki documents, confirm that this environment variable is set:

`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIR`

It must point to the local Obsidian Vault root. If it is missing, ask the user for the vault location before writing wiki documents.

### Wiki Root

Store project wiki documents in the Obsidian Vault:

`${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIR}/10-Projects/Lechigo`

If the folder does not exist, create it.

### Shared Rules

Follow the shared Project Wiki Mode rules:

`${OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIR}/10-Projects/LLM Markdown Wiki System/08 Project Wiki Mode.md`

### During Work

- Solve the user's actual task first.
- Record important decisions and failures in `90 Logs/`.
- Promote stable setup and operation commands to `03 Operations Runbook.md`.
- Promote failures and fixes to `04 Troubleshooting.md`.
- Promote reusable concepts to `05 Knowledge Map.md`.
- Do not spend excessive time polishing wiki docs during active implementation.

### After Work

Before calling the task complete, update the project wiki with:

- What changed
- How it was verified
- Important decisions
- New operations commands
- Troubleshooting notes
- Reusable knowledge

### Public Documents

Only add this frontmatter to documents that are safe to publish:

```md
---
visibility: public
---
```

Never include real sensitive values in public documents.

Do not expose real domains, internal IPs, usernames, hostnames, SSH ports, Device IDs, tokens, cookies, API keys, private repository URLs, local home paths, or raw secrets.

Use placeholders such as `example.com`, `192.0.2.10`, `user`, `/path/to/project`, and `private repository`.

### If Unsure

If unsure where to store wiki documents, ask before writing.

Do not default to writing wiki documents into the current repository.
